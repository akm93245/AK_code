TensorBoard is a powerful tool for visualizing and monitoring machine learning experiments. Below is a simple example of how to use TensorBoard with TensorFlow. This code demonstrates logging the training process of a simple neural network.

### Simple TensorBoard Example

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import datetime

# Create a simple model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate some dummy data
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.random((1000, 10))
y_train = np.random.randint(2, size=(1000, 1))

# Define TensorBoard log directory
log_dir = "logs/fit/" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir, histogram_freq=1)

# Train the model with TensorBoard callback
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])

# To launch TensorBoard, use the following command in your terminal:
# tensorboard --logdir logs/fit
```

### How to Use It:
1. Save the code above in a Python file, e.g., `tensorboard_example.py`.
2. Run the script to generate logs.
3. Launch TensorBoard by running the command:
   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir logs/fit
   ```
4. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6006` to visualize the logs.

TensorBoard is a powerful visualization tool for machine learning experiments, but it doesn't have a specific "code" in the traditional sense. Instead, it's integrated with TensorFlow and other frameworks to log and visualize various aspects of your training process.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

**1. Logging Data:**

- **TensorFlow:** You use TensorFlow's `tf.summary` API to log metrics like loss, accuracy, and other relevant data during your training process.
- **Other Frameworks:** Similar logging mechanisms exist in other frameworks like PyTorch and Keras.

**2. Running TensorBoard:**

You start TensorBoard by running the following command in your terminal, specifying the log directory:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir logs/
```

**3. Visualizing Data:**

TensorBoard opens in your web browser and displays various dashboards:

- **Scalars:** Visualizes scalar metrics like loss and accuracy over time.
- **Histograms:** Shows the distribution of tensor values.
- **Images:** Displays images generated during training.
- **Graphs:** Visualizes the computational graph of your model.
- **Projector:** Embeds high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space for visualization.
- **Profiler:** Analyzes the performance of your TensorFlow program.

**Example Code (TensorFlow):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your model and training loop ...

# Log training accuracy every 100 steps
with tf.summary.record_if(True):
    tf.summary.scalar('training_accuracy', train_accuracy, step=step)

# Log validation loss every 100 steps
with tf.summary.record_if(True):
    tf.summary.scalar('validation_loss', val_loss, step=step)

# Write the summary to disk
writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./logs')
writer.close()
```

**Key Points:**

- TensorBoard doesn't have a standalone codebase. It's integrated with frameworks and libraries.
- You interact with it through the command line and web interface.
- The core functionality is provided by the underlying frameworks and logging APIs.

By effectively using TensorBoard, you can gain valuable insights into your machine learning experiments and make informed decisions to improve your models.
