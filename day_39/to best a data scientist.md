* **Cleaning and Preprocessing:** They clean and preprocess data to remove errors, inconsistencies, and missing values.
* **Data Integration:** They combine data from different sources into a unified dataset.

**Data Analysis and Exploration:**

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** They use statistical techniques and visualizations to understand data characteristics and patterns.
* **Feature Engineering:** They create new features from existing data to improve model performance.

**Model Building and Training:**

* **Machine Learning:** They use machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
* **Model Selection:** They choose the most appropriate algorithms for the problem at hand.
* **Model Training:** They train models on the prepared data to learn patterns.

**Model Evaluation and Deployment:**

* **Model Evaluation:** They assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
* **Model Optimization:** They refine models to improve their accuracy and efficiency.
* **Model Deployment:** They deploy models into production environments for real-world use.

**Communication and Collaboration:**

* **Data Storytelling:** They communicate insights and findings to non-technical stakeholders effectively.
* **Collaboration:** They work with domain experts and other teams to understand business needs and translate them into data-driven solutions.

**Additional Tasks:**

* **Data Visualization:** They create visualizations to communicate insights visually.
* **A/B Testing:** They conduct experiments to test hypotheses and measure the impact of changes.
* **Automation:** They automate data pipelines and model retraining to improve efficiency.
